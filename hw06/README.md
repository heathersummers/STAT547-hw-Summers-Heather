### Report Your Process:
I first started doing task #3 but struggled with understanding the `stringr` package including how to clean the "non-word" text using various characters. I used the notes from past STAT545 classes but still found it difficult so I have left that for another time. I struggled with finding notes and websites that were helpful for writing functions but did find several useful links when I was working with the nested data frame (see below). Overall, I found this assignment much harder and more time consuming than any of the previous assignments.
