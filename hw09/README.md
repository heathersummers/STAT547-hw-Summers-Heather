### Reflection on the Process:
I found creating the functions fairly simple however struggled a little more with creating the test_that R scripts. I found this [link](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf) very helpful in explaining different expectation and test_that functions. I also struggled with uploading my package to GitHub since the icons for push and pull were not working. In the end I moved my package to a different folder in my computer and it seemed to work fine but I am still unsure what went wrong before. I found this assignment very interesting and I see how it could be very helpful to create an R package for data or functions.
