### Report Your Process:
At first, I found this assignment somewhat difficult because I kept getting errors in my code however, by following Jenny Bryan's examples I was able to overcome the small errors in the script. By completing this assignment I learned a lot about the process of automating pipelines and I hope to use Makefiles in future assignments. I found creating the figures and reordering the data quite easy since we have been working on creating quality graphs for several weeks.
