## STAT545 Homework 08
[Return to Main Page](https://github.com/heathersummers/STAT547-hw-Summers-Heather)

This folder contains homework assignment #8 for Heather Summers.

I made improvements to the BC Liquor Store app, please see [hw08 BC Liquor Store Prices app](https://heathersummers.shinyapps.io/hw08_BC_Liquor_Store_Prices/). The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/shiny_supp/2016/bcl-data.csv). For details on the code used to make the shiny app please see the [app.R](https://github.com/heathersummers/STAT547-hw-Summers-Heather/blob/master/hw08/app.R), [ui.R](https://github.com/heathersummers/STAT547-hw-Summers-Heather/blob/master/hw08/ui.R), and [server.R](https://github.com/heathersummers/STAT547-hw-Summers-Heather/blob/master/hw08/server.R) documents. Also the instructions for this assignment can be found on the [STAT545 Website](http://stat545.com/hw08_shiny.html).

[Thus Shiny app](https://heathersummers.shinyapps.io/hw08_BC_Liquor_Store_Prices/) allows the user to see the number of products, alcohol content, subtypes, price, name, and sweetness that are available for the selected product types (i.e. wine, beer, spirits, refreshment), price range, and country. 

### New features added to the BC Liquor Store app:
- used the DT package to make beautiful, interactive tables
- used the package `shinythemes` to change the appearance of the app
- made the following changes to the histogram: changed the axis titles, added a title for the plot, fill colour is determined by the product type, font is black and of size 20
- allowed the user to download the results table as a .csv file (bcliquor_results-YYYY-MM-DD.csv) using the functions `downloadButton()` and `downloadHandler()`
- allowed the user to search for multiple product types simultaneously (instead of only being able to choose one product type) using the function `checkboxGroupInput()`
- added an image of the BC liquor store logo
- added a link to the dataset and acknowledged its source (i.e. direct access to the data)
- showed the number of results found whenever the filters change (i.e. "We found x options for you:")

### Reflection on the Process:
I found this assignment really interesting and enjoyed learning about Shiny app. I found adding most new features to be fairly simple and used several websites (see below) for guidance. When choosing a shiny theme I used the live theme selector `shinythemes::themeSelector()` in order to test out different themes with the application. I struggled for a while with the download button since everything was working properly except that when I tried to save the results it wasn't saving as a .csv file but found [this](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.0.5/downloadHandler.html) website very helpful. I also really wanted to add the feature that sorts the results table by price but unfortunately was unable to do so and had to give up for now but will continue to look into.
